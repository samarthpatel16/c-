So far as the code is concerned, there was not much difficulty in compiling the code however in the beginning I faced many challenges to run this program in the matrix server. Also, initially there were many errors that were solved using debugger and it took a long to solve all them.2. //let us say for example take a integer 5;#define _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS#include <stdio.h>int main (void){    int x=5;        if (!(x>4 || x>2))        {            printf("yes");        }            else if (!(x>4) && !(x>2))    {        printf("yes");    }        else {        printf("no");    }}Hence both the conditions i.e,     if (!(x>4 || x>2)) and  (!(x>4) && !(x>2)) are same and can be implemented in two different ways but will produce the same output.3. Yes, in part 1 we created a variable to store the calculated average product prices whereas we did not store the converted Celsius to Fahrenheit temperature unit in a separate variable in part 2. Furthermore, according to me it is a better practice not to store a value in a variable unless necessary, to avoid extra consumption of space from the computer’s memory. Thus, according to me the preferred approach was the second one because we were not using extra space from the computer’s memory for declaring a variable and storing a value to it.
