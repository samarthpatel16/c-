1. (a) Using switch case selection constructs :
 
switch(month)
{
case 1: printf("JAN");
       break;
case 2: printf("FEB");
       break;
case 3: printf(“MAR”);
	      break;
 default:
  printf("");
}


(b) Using else-if  selection constructs:
  
 if (month == 1)
{

           printf("JAN");

       else if (month == 2)
	{

           printf("FEB");

		else if (month == 3)
		{

           		printf("MAR");

		}

	}

}




2. 
The 3 types of iteration constructs :
  
* while loop
* do while
* for loop

While and do-while both are good options if we want to validate a particular object because we needed to traverse through the valid month integers to check if the input value
is one of the valid values. 

For example:


        while (mr < 0.0 || mr>5.0)

        {
            printf("      ERROR: Rating must be between 0.0 and 5.0 inclusive!");//printing the //messsage

            printf("\n   Morning rating (0.0-5.0): ");

            scanf("%f", &mr);

        }

        ms = ms + mr;//changing the value of ms



        printf("   Evening rating (0.0-5.0): ");

        scanf("%f", &er);



        while (er < 0.0 || er>5.0)

        {

            printf("      ERROR: Rating must be between 0.0 and 5.0 inclusive!");//printing the //messsage

            printf("\n   Evening rating (0.0-5.0): ");

            scanf("%f", &er);

        }

        es = es + er; //changing the value of es



3. To test and debug my program I generally use one of the online integrated learning environment known as cs50 ide. I set several breakpoints wherever necessary and tried to run the program again and again by closely examining the values of variables and other calculations. This is a best way to run your program line to line and keep a watch on the values and calculations. By performing several steps, I finally was able to locate the error and then debug my program.
