*/1)void viewAllAppointments(struct ClinicData* data);In this function i displayed all the appointments read from the file by display the appointment date and time and then the patient informaion by iterating through all the patients and displaying the patient with the same patient numbervoid viewAppointmentSchedule(struct ClinicData* data);In this function i asked the user for the information about the appointments such as date and then by iterating through the appointments, i displayed the appointments with the same date and the patient who made that appointmentvoid addAppointment(struct Appointment* appointments, int maxAppointments, struct Patient* patients, int maxPatient);In this function i asked user for all the information about the appointment to be added such as date, time, patient number, and then stored the appointment with the rest of the appointments. This function was an essential one because it was the only way we could add new appoinments2)The add appointment function must perform many operations like inputting the information for the appointment, input validation and so on. It took me 75 lines of code to write this function, because of all the error checking and other stuff. The most crucial part was to input the date of the appointment as there are different number of days for each month of the year. And error checking like input validation was required for each step.3)This milestone was tougher than the previous milestones as it required error checking on each and every point in the application, also in this milestone we had to use file handling to read all the patients’ data and appointment data from their files, and then work on it. This milestone required constant hours of effort.The viewAppointment functions were easier as compared to the others because there wasn't much of error checking in this function, the only problem I faced in these functions was to sort the appointments first and then display them. For the other functions like addAppointment and removeAppointment were rather tough than the display functions because we had to validate each and every input by the user.
